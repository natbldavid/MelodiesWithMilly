    text: "The Elsa entertainer was the absolute highlight of my daughter’s birthday! She sang beautifully and was so sweet with all the kids, keeping them engaged throughout. We have 100% trust in Milly and her ability to supply quality entertainment. Milly herself is incredibly reliable and hardworking, and very well-loved amongst all the mums in the local community. I wouldn’t hesitate to recommend her and will definitely be using her services again.",
